# University-Students-Data-API
Project Description: University Students Data API

The University Students Data API is a project designed to support four essential operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for manipulating a database of students studying in a university. The API provides functionality to manage a single dataset that includes the following information for each student: Student ID, first name, last name, middle name, gender, and roles.

Key Features:
- GET Operation: Retrieve student data from the database.
- POST Operation: Add new student data to the database.
- PUT Operation: Update existing student data in the database.
- DELETE Operation: Remove student data from the database.

API Functionality:
1. GET Operation:
   - Retrieve student information from the database based on various filters such as Student ID, first name, last name, etc.
   - Retrieve a list of all students in the database.
   - Supports pagination and sorting options for efficient data retrieval.

2. POST Operation:
   - Add a new student to the database by providing all the necessary details such as Student ID, first name, last name, middle name, gender, and roles.
   - Validate and ensure data integrity before adding the student to the database.

3. PUT Operation:
   - Update existing student information in the database.
   - Modify any of the available fields for a specific student, such as first name, last name, middle name, gender, or roles.

4. DELETE Operation:
   - Remove a student from the database based on the provided Student ID.
   - Perform necessary validations and checks before deleting the student data.

Additional Considerations:
- Implement robust error handling and response codes to handle various scenarios.
- Apply authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to the API.
- Utilize appropriate database management techniques for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- Implement data validation to ensure data integrity and consistency.
- Consider implementing logging and monitoring functionalities for debugging and performance analysis.

With the University Students Data API, users can easily manage and manipulate student data within a university, facilitating efficient data operations and supporting various applications and systems that rely on accurate student information.
